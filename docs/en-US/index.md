## Why - Why encapsulate this component library

This component library aims to encapsulate some commonly used extended components based on Element Plus in daily development.

## What - Encapsulated Content

- Alias: Optimizes multiple loops, defines temporary variables, and facilitates concise access to temporary variables in templates.
- AvatarList: A group of user avatars, commonly used in project/team member lists.
- Banner: Banners are usually used to indicate the status or notifications of the entire page.
- ConfirmableButton: Usually used for operations that require reconfirmation.
- DockContainer: Mainly used to contain collapsed ModelessDialogs.
- ***ModelessDialog: A non-modal dialog box that supports functions such as maximize, minimize, collapse, expand, and drag to resize.***
- OverflowList: Usually used for table operation columns. When there are many operation items, this component can be used to show or hide operations.
- Panel: A panel component, similar to the Card component, but more flexible and versatile.
- SimpleTable: A very lightweight table component that only uses HTML table to implement common functions.
- Spinner: Displays a "loading" working status.
- TextOverflow: Makes text overflow by setting the text length or component width.
- TreeTransfer: Performs selection operations on tree structures.
